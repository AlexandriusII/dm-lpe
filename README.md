OpenSource PHP landing page engine/constructor to create landing pages with dynamic content.

## I want to see a demo

Yes, of course, follow [this link](http://dm.drteam.rocks) you can see a [SB Creative](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-creative) Landing Page.

Follow [this link](http://dm.drteam.rocks/auth/login) if you want to see the administrative interface, username and password are `admin`.

Do not be afraid to break something, the site in read-only mode, so you can try whatever you want.

## How to install

    git clone https://github.com/DrTeamRocks/dm-lpe.git
